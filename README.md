# winning-jeopardy

This is the guided project of ["Hypothesis Testing: Fundamentals"](https://app.dataquest.io/course/probability-statistics-intermediate) at Dataquest.

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US, which is been running for a few decades. The participants answer question to win money.

We want to compete on Jeopardy and you are looking for how to get to win. In this project, we try to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you by analyzing a dataset of Jeopardy.
